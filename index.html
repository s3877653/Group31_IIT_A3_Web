            <div class="overview">
                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                <p><i>Topic:</i></p>
                <p>With the rapid development of the internet, it is obvious that an enormous amount of data is collected, consumed or delivered daily. Due to this reason, many tech companies have started developing servers to be easier to handle data. However, as the amount of data is increasing, companies are forced to have further upgrades on the servers, which requires a large amount of money. Therefore, they started developing cloud storage, which also has high storage capacity but offers lower cost of maintenance. Cloud storage is implemented not only for businesses, but also for individuals to increase their daily productivity. Realizing the great potential of cloud storage, our team also decided to build a cloud storage application ourselves.</p>
                <p>Our cloud storage should be a representation of fast adaptation since the IT world is evolving rapidly. It will support both offline and online environments, multiple operating systems from mobile devices such as IOS, Android to desktops devices like MacOs, Windows, etc… Moreover, our application will categorize data and allow people to adjust their own setting, helping the storage to be more personalized. In short, our storage will serve small businesses and individuals with better personalization compared to other companies.</p>
                <p><i>Motivation</i></p>
                <p>Finally, a leader who can connects all the members, giving out suitable recommendations, who has a skilled communication which would help for a better explanation and supervisor the project. A good leader is a key to optimize and utilize the project and ensure the productivity of the software.</p>
                <p><i>Landscape:</i></p>
                <p>There are many popular companies which have already developed this type of technology such as Apple with iCloud, Google with Drive, Microsoft with Onedrive, etc… However, these cloud storage services require the internet in order to have further access to the data in the storage. With many people, this is still fine since the internet is all over the world right now. However, we think this still consists of inadequacies because many countries with low incomes or with high internet costs would not be able to sustain the internet daily or monthly. Therefore, we have decided that our cloud storage will be able to utilise both offline and online environments. It can store data offline and when there is an internet connection, it will automatically synchronise the data to the customers’ storage accounts. This is the main difference between our project and other competitors, and this will be further discussed in the detailed description.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Detailed-Description">
                <h2>Detailed Description:</h2>
                <div class="aims">
                    <p><i>Aims:</i></p>
                    <p>Aim: “ Building a cloud storage application”.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, the main aim of this project is to finish building the cloud storage. Normally, doing a project requires a lot of skills, knowledge, experience as well as hard work and this project is not an exception. With the aim of providing to users a cloud storage application which has one of the most adaptive and easy-to-use interfaces, there are 3 goals that need to be achieved.</p>
                    <p>Goal 1: “Get to know all the requirements to build the storage application”</p>
                    <p>Assuming that we have completed our university programs by the time we begin our project, and yet this project requires a high level of knowledge, we must still review what we have learned. The understanding of the programming languages such as Python or SQL, which are required for the project has to be revisited. Furthermore, many applications such as Oracle, Adobe, or other third parties also require the developers to have knowledge about. Last but not least, as we also want the cloud storage to run on different environments and platforms, we have to do research to ensure that the cloud storage will run consistently.</p>
                    <p>Goal 2: “Construct a Database center”</p>
                    <p>As we are doing about cloud storage, we definitely have to deal with data. This is the most important goal in order to complete the project. If there is no data, there is no cloud storage either. Therefore, we need to have a deep understanding about third parties that allow us to create our own data server such as mySQL or Oracle Apex. From there, we proceed further in personalizing the data for the users. </p>
                    <p>Goal 3: “Keep the UI simple”</p>
                    <p>User Interface is the second-most crucial to this application. With the aim of giving users the high level of easy-to-use interface, some tasks such as using words to describe the features, icons, and the structure of how to use the application, all have to be as simple as they can so that many users can understand and use the application correctly right at the first time without any of complicated processes. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="Plans-and-Progress">
                    <p><i>Plans and Progress:</i></p>
                    <p>a.Plan:</p>
                    <p>Since this is a project, multiple tasks, team meetings, testing and therefore a large amount of time are needed in order for it to run perfectly. For this reason, we created a plan to be easier to access and check the tasks as well as fixing whenever a problem occurs.</p>
                    <p>-  After we have revised our knowledge, we will do a lot of research about how to build our own cloud storage application, we have to understand the requirements of this project. Then, we will start to do our project.</p>
                    <p>- First of all, we will need a host server, we will buy a hardware server that can store our data, however, since we are only students, we can only afford a small host server, this is also the reason why we created the cloud storage to serve only small businesses and individuals.</p>
                    <p>- Secondly, we create a database server, this server will contain all the data of our customers, to do this, we need to use mySQL or Oracle Apex to deal with the data. After that, we will divide the data into different categories (names, password, . We assign the data so that it can automatically fit with the users’ information. Apparently, this requires us to have a deep understanding of data, its primary keys, relationships, etc… and we will use Python for the application to automatically understand and fit the keys with the customers information.</p>
                    <p>- Thirdly, we will create an automatic portal between offline and online devices so that the application can store the data offline and will synchronize to the online server whenever their devices have internet connection. To do this we will implement the codes using JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>- Furthermore, as this is a cloud storage that contains all information of clients, security is a top priority that we have to take into consideration. The storage is developed in both offline and online environments, therefore it is obvious that we have to secure it in these two environments as well. To do this, we need to have understanding about C and C++ to check the unusual access into the application as well as the cloud storage.</p>
                    <p>- Next, we will design and create the UI and UX of the app. This will follow our aim in the above part, which is keeping things simple. We will also make an app to allow users to personalize their profile by changing pictures, backgrounds, themes, data type, etc…</p>
                    <p>- We will also update and create the UI and UX for the online websites as well so that it can fit with the offline application.</p>
                    <p>- When everything is completed, we will test the application, by asking our friends to download it and receive feedback to further improve our app.</p>
                    <p>To simplify and further illustrate our plan, this will specifically show how our desired project works:</p>
                    <p>- When the users download the application to their devices, there will be an option which will enable the devices to automatically save their works offline, after that, when there is an internet connection, the devices will automatically synchronise their works to their account in the cloud server, which is distributed on a website with exactly the same contents with the offline application. In our perceptions, this would help users to avoid data loss, keeping their devices clean without using too much memory. </p>
                    <p><i>b.Progress:</i></p>
                    <p>As this is week 4, we have fully established the project idea to the whole team. Each team member has well noticed their roles and responsibilities in the project. At first, we want the application to be fully automatic, meaning that we don’t have to enable it when we want it to automatically save the work offline. However, Thinh mentioned that many people want to use the cloud storage because they don’t want to have too much data, which can slow down or overheat their devices. So we changed it by applying a switch, creating an option for users. Other than that, we have stuck to the plan since it started and have no more changes to the project. However, as mentioned before, this is an ambitious project, and it requires a deep knowledge about tools and cloud computing, which we are still short of. We will continue to learn about the tools and requirements such as Python, SQL, HTML, etc… to finish the project on time or at least some parts of it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="roles">
                    <h3>Roles:</h3>
                    <p> Our group project have these roles which had contributed to the success of the project:</p>
                    <p>Firstly, as an application, our project need to have a good front-end deisgn so Long and Tuan will take the UX UI design role as they have good experience in design, especially in application UX UI design</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we need a website for selling and marketing our product so Khoi, who has some experience in web development, will take this role since he has better website development  knowledge than others.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly,to develop the application Long and Khoi will take the Python coding part since we have learned Python before. Thinh and Tuan will develop the SQL part as they have learned the database course.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Thinh will take the report writing role as he is the leader of the group who assigns the tasks to everyone so he knows the project more than the others. Moreover he is a very organised person and he has great skill in writing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="scope-and-limits">
                    <h3>Scope and limits:</h3>
                    <p>This is our scope for this project:</p>
                    <p>First we will make the application.To start,we will make the app front-end, the application will have a user-friendly interface design. We will also make the app responsive and available on both mobile and PC</p>
                    <p>
                        Next we will use the app back end. We will use SQL to connect the app with Cloud and sync with the da offline file. Python will be used to create files with passwords to store Data when offline. 
                        Then, we are going to make a website to advertise and also sell the product. We will make a nice, user friendly design for the website. People will see how the application works, what benefit it can bring and the review from the consumer on the web. We will also make our web secure to protect the user information.
                        </p>
                    <p>Limits:</p>
                    <p>-Because we don't have so much experience with web and application design so it will take us some time to find material, tools to learn and practice.</p>
                    <p>-Also we are not familiar with the security and this is the important aspect as it relate to the user private information so we need to spend lots of time to learn and make a perfect security system for the web as well as the application</p>
                    <p>-The storage of the application is limited as it serve mostly individual and small businesses</p>
                    <p>-The database servers are not too big.</p>    
                </div>
                <div class="tool-and-technology">
                    <h3>Tools and technology:</h3>
                    <p>As this is an ambitious project, we need a lot of resources in order to complete it perfectly. The requirements are:</p>
                    <p>- Hardware servers to store the data and information, the servers will be upgraded when the number of users increases.</p>
                    <p>- Deep learning about data and SQL: since this is a project about cloud storage, data is a crucial complement of the project, all team members have to have fundamental knowledge about data, and have to know the applications such as mySQL, Oracle Apex to deal with data of users</p>
                    <p>- Programming languages: the difficult part of the project is the automatic synchronization, therefore, members have to have programming languages such as Python or JS to implement to the application.
                        Besides, C and C++ are also required to secure the application, and HTML and JS to design and create UI on the websites.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="testing">
                    <h3>Testing:</h3>
                    <p>-Some people think that the developers know their product the most, just like how a mother knows her baby best. However just because they created the application does not mean they know it the best. This is because they have biases and most importantly the developers are not your users. This is why we need to test our products.</p>
                    <p>-There are 2 types of testing that we are planning to do, user testing which involves users and server testing which does not require any participant. Before we come up with a fully completed, refined product we need to do testing. First we will need to create a mockup of our project, after that we will use tools like paper.io or online prototype tools to create our first prototype. Our first prototype will be quick and rough, this means that it will not look well polished like the final product but it will have key features that we want in our final product. Now we need to look for our users, we should apply design thinking here. We need to know what do our users want from our application, why are they using it, what are they using it for. The next step after that is making a persona, a profile, a user that will use our application. The information in this persona can be their age group, profession, reason they are using it, their knowledge on software and other soft skills that they have. For example, if our users are mostly college students we can look for users, participants in RMIT or other colleges. The user testing phase began when we finished our prototype, a form asking participants to give us the right to own and share their information, a list of tasks to give to users and an interview question and answer form.</p>
                    <p>-To test user experience first we will ask them the right to own information they have given, this will include their age, gender, name, ethnicity, skills navigating new software and using new technology. After they have agreed to participate, we will begin to give them a list of tasks that we want the users to do. Beforehand these goals will be broken down to small step by step tasks for us to compare with what step the user is doing. This will help us see which step troubles the user the most and how intuitive our application is for new users. The users will also be timed because speed is also a very important factor when determining how successful our product is. Afterward there will be one final question and answer interview to ask for more information like what the users found useful, bad, hard to understand, what they think about the app, what they think will improve our product.</p>
                    <p>-The server testing will be conducted after our final product is finished. We will launch a test server to see if our server is online and working. We will test if we can store anything in the server database. We will also check up with an IT security expert to see if our server protections, like firewall for example, are strong enough to fend off cyber attacks.</p>

                    <h3>Risks:</h3>
                    <p>-There are many risks to consider in our project. The first that comes to mind is funding, since our application is a cloud, an online storage system we need money to buy physical servers and databases. Also since we plan to have many servers in different locations this means that it will cost much more and there might be errors that are hard to manage given the different locations thus different time zones. The integrity and the image of the project is a hugely crucial part, you wouldn’t want to store your life savings in some banks that have bad customer service, horrible online application qualities and worst of all poor security. This means that to store users data means that we have the responsibility to protect it, online data is prone to cyber threat, criminal or even organized crime cyber attack, hackers. Even if our servers are attacked only once, it could result in a lot of users' information leaking thus tarnishing our image, integrity and project as a whole. Angry customers can also boycott our product so one of the most serious threats are cyber attacks. Integrating a presentation application, a word application, a spreadsheet application and a presentation tool will be a ginormous obstacle for us. Since we have limited knowledge on software engineering, plus to make these applications intuitive it should follow most of Microsoft's features, which are long, extensive and difficult to create and implement. Another minor potential issue is accessibility, we need to make sure that our servers are always available and users can connect to it from anywhere. We might face a big problem of a small firm using our cloud to access it from a certain location. Also legal risks might come from this because for example what if the country leader decides to ban our application in their country.</p>

            <h3>Group Reflection:</h3>
            <p>Long: I think we have communicated well so far, all of my teammates appeared when I needed them to demonstrate my idea. Tuan is very active and responsive, everytime he does not understand something, he is not shy and starts asking questions, which is very good in my opinion. Khoi also did very well his assigned tasks without any problems. Thinh with great writing skill is very helpful to our team when doing the writing work. However, we are still having some problems as this is the end of semester and our schedules are quite different and busy, so our time availability is also affected. We started this project quite late compared to other teams and we need to improve our time management skill in order to finish the project on time. Other than that, there is no problem and I feel lucky doing this project with these people. If I have the opportunity to choose the team again, I still choose this team and these people to be my teammates.</p>
            <p>Thinh: For this project, I think that we as a group did well overall. Especially on coming up with ideas and implementing them. Each member of the group was extremely active and thoughtful when we were brainstorming. This makes the hardest part of the part of the project in my opinion, the idea and starting it, went by much smoother. However looking back to this project we could have been more keen on time. Time management is key to a good project. This doesn’t mean we were cramped and running out of time. It meant that we didn’t have a clear time schedule, a detailed plan for the project so time management was harder than usual but still manageable. Although I think we could have created a better paper if we had a detailed plan. It was surprising to me that despite that fact everything else went great, members were active, responsive and responsible most of all. I learned one thing is that a plan might seem simple and easily neglected but it is the oil to help the group run smoothly. It helps us keep track of time and most importantly progress of each member. Thus adjusting our performance and expectation correctly for the next week.</p>
            <p>Khoi: I think our group did a pretty good job. The group members were very active, they always appeared in the group meeting and contributed their ideas for the project. Tuan is very talkative, he always contributes and asks questions about the project. I myself think I have done a good job, I help improve the website and contribute to the project ideal. Thinh is very good with his writing and organizing the developing process of the project. Long have done a very good job too. Although we have some time management problems I was surprised that we were able to finish all the tasks in time, next time I will pay more attention to the time management aspect of the project.</p>
            <p> Tuan: Our team contains enthusiasm and studious members, there is no complaining about this. We have been through all the group assignments and after each activity, each of us get to know more about the others. Long is a good team leader who has a brilliant idea and is willing to give a hand. Thinh is a quiet person but always finishes the job on time and also gives out good ideas. Khoi is a walk the talk person, he can do everything like coding and making a website. This makes our team undoubtedly more perfect compared to other teams. I wish that we could do more work together in the future.</p>
